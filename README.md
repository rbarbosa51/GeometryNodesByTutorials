## What this book is about
This book is a tutorial based approach to learning the Geometry Nodes system that ships with Blender 3.3.
It allows you to create dynamic shapes by using nodes. This will allow you to create extraordinary, flexible and modifiable geometrical shapes. You will then be able to parametrically alter the shape of these objects by making changes thru the modifier interface.

### Topics Covered
* Basics of the Geometry Nodes modifier.
* Instantiate points on the surface of meshes.
* How to select specific instances.
* Create composite shapes.
* Manipulate Curves objects dynamically.
* How to draw dynamic geometric shapes.
* How to use the new Volume nodes.
* How to use the new Edge Path nodes.
